# Clip To Kindle

This is a very very simple Android app that sends the contents(almost are URLs) of clipboard to Kindle ebook reader.

## How to use

The app can be easily used in 3 steps

1. Start the app on your phone.
2. Keep the app in background then go to copy sth. The URL copied will be automatically added to your app. You can manually remove them in the app.
3. Start the web browser on your Kindle ebook reader. Input the link hinted in the phone app. For example, if there is a message shown that listening on port 8080 IP address: 192.168.0.2, you should input 192.168.0.2:8080 in your reader's web browser
4. Enjoy :)
